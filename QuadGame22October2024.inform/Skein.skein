The Quad Game: Welcome to the University of Illinois
An Interactive Fiction by the Electronic Literatures &amp; Literacies Lab
Release 1 / Serial number 241119 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

The Quad Game is an Interactive Fiction sandbox created at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. To date it has had 100+ authors who have written 258,155 words,  creating 818 locations, 1694 things, 239 persons, and 67 narrative resolutions but no ending. Like all sandboxes, this one has bugs. New authors learn to write code by finding and fixing them, invariably leaving new bugs for future contributors to find. The Quad Game is a text-based game. What you can do will be context-specific but here are the basics: 

 LOOK (L) helps you to recall where you are.
 EXAMINE (X) things listed in descriptions and TAKE whatever you can.
 INVENTORY (I) shows you what you are carrying.
 GO north or any other cardinal direction (N, NW, NE, S, SW, SE, W, E), or up and down. 
 GO in(side), out(side), ENTER or EXIT campus buildings or enterable containers. 
 WHICH WAY (WAY) provides available directions.
 TALK TO people and ASK them ABOUT relevant topics.
 SNAPor PHOTOGRAPH things you find curious or beautiful. 
 STATUS will show your progress.
 HELP will repeat these instructions. CREDITS will give credit where credit is due. 
 Finally, SAVE your game before you QUIT or your progress will be lost!

Siebel Center for Design
You are standing outside the west entrance of the Center for Design. You can enter it from here, go north to George Huff Hall or south to Art and Design. Flagg Hall is due west, across the street.

Flagg Hall
This building's history as a dorm is obvious from its exterior. Now it houses the studios for several different majors in the college of Art and Design. The entrance that most people use is a wheel-chair ramp on the east side of the building. The grander front doors sit unused off of the south side of the building.

Far to the east is the Architecture Building.  Inside the door in front of you is the 1st floor of Flagg Hall.

Irwin Indoor Football facility
You are standing in front of Irwin Indoor Football Facility at the east of the ARC. There is a truly enormous statue of a football player here. You can see Taft Van Doren Hall to the north, the ARC is to the west, and the School of Art and Design is to the northeast.

Illini Stadium
You are standing outside the Big Ten Football field where the Illini play. There's nothing happening her at the moment, and the doors are locked. You can return to the ARC to the north and to the Indoor Football Facility to the northeast.

You hear a brief, but lovely set of harmonic dings, downloaded from a recording of a Tuvan throat singer, that indicates you have received a text.

There's a small panel next to the elevator doors, but the button part is smoothed over. A keyhole sits underneath. This is weird, considering there's another normal down button on the other side.

You are standing at the west end of the Siebel Center for Design, locally known as "SCD". A support desk is in front of you, but strangely there isn't a person manning it. there are classrooms to the northwest and southwest.

Front of elevator
In front of you is an elevator that you can use to go to the lower floors. However, there is a sign on it that says "Out of Order"

There's a small panel next to the elevator doors, but the button part is smoothed over. A keyhole sits underneath. This is weird, considering there's another normal down button on the other side.

Study hallway
Rows of white tables sit under equally white walls, which upon closer inspection, are whiteboards. The area is blindingly bright.

West Terrace
You are standing at the west end of the Siebel Center for Design, locally known as "SCD". A support desk is in front of you, but strangely there isn't a person manning it. there are classrooms to the northwest and southwest.

Gallery
You are surprised at how open this area feels and see that there are a lot of places that you can sit in. Other students are casually sitting around: working on homework, playing on their phone, or just casually resting. You feel relaxed at the sight of this.
