The Quad Game: Welcome to the University of Illinois
An Interactive Fiction by the Electronic Literatures &amp; Literacies Lab
Release 1 / Serial number 241203 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

The Quad Game is an Interactive Fiction sandbox created at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. To date it has had 100+ authors who have written 258,155 words,  creating 827 locations, 1714 things, 239 persons, and 67 narrative resolutions but no ending. Like all sandboxes, this one has bugs. New authors learn to write code by finding and fixing them, invariably leaving new bugs for future contributors to find. The Quad Game is a text-based game. What you can do will be context-specific but here are the basics: 

 LOOK (L) helps you to recall where you are.
 EXAMINE (X) things listed in descriptions and TAKE whatever you can.
 INVENTORY (I) shows you what you are carrying.
 GO north or any other cardinal direction (N, NW, NE, S, SW, SE, W, E), or up and down. 
 GO in(side), out(side), ENTER or EXIT campus buildings or enterable containers. 
 WHICH WAY (WAY) provides available directions.
 TALK TO people and ASK them ABOUT relevant topics.
 SNAPor PHOTOGRAPH things you find curious or beautiful. 
 STATUS will show your progress.
 HELP will repeat these instructions. CREDITS will give credit where credit is due. 
 Finally, SAVE your game before you QUIT or your progress will be lost!

Siebel Center for Design

Flagg Hall
This building's history as a dorm is obvious from its exterior. Now it houses the studios for several different majors in the college of Art and Design. The entrance that most people use is a wheel-chair ramp on the east side of the building. The grander front doors sit unused off of the south side of the building.

Far to the east is the Architecture Building.  Inside the door in front of you is the 1st floor of Flagg Hall.

You have noticed the summer days getting shorter and the air getting crisper. Autumn is here and the fall semester at the University of Illinois has already well begun.

The caffinator is one of the many UIUC dining locations, meaning it accepts dining dollars and Illini-Bucks. Other than that, it's like most other middling coffee places.

Far to the east is the Architecture Building.  Inside the door in front of you is the 1st floor of Flagg Hall.

Front of elevator
In front of you is an elevator that you can use to go to the lower floors. However, there is a sign on it that says "Out of Order"

There's a small panel next to the elevator doors, but the button part is smoothed over. A keyhole sits underneath. This is weird, considering there's another normal down button on the other side.

 Looks like there are students here working on projects together. You can see groups clearly with each cluster of students having open discussions with each other.

Front of elevator
In front of you is an elevator that you can use to go to the lower floors. However, there is a sign on it that says "Out of Order"

There's a small panel next to the elevator doors, but the button part is smoothed over. A keyhole sits underneath. This is weird, considering there's another normal down button on the other side.

West Terrace
You are standing at the west end of the Siebel Center for Design, locally known as "SCD". A support desk is in front of you, but strangely there isn't a person manning it. there are classrooms to the northwest and southwest.

You feel your caffeine headache getting worse.

You are surprised at how open this area feels and see that there are a lot of places that you can sit in. Other students are casually sitting around: working on homework, playing on their phone, or just casually resting. You feel relaxed at the sight of this.
